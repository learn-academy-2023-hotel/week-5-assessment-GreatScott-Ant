# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: To implement a "TDD workflow" refers to a style of programming which test-driven development is the focus. This method consists of writing a small portion of the code that describes what the code should do, then another that runs the test and then makes the test successful. Then lastly repeats the process.

Researched answer: Test-driven development is a popular development workflow that consists of three (3) parts: unit testing, programming, and refactoring. What this looks like is: initially writing a unit of test cases that before creating the actual code. The first set of code describes the action or intent of the code, and has a "positive" failure when tested. The next step is then writing the smallest amount of code that will make the test pass. Lastly any refractor code is added and the steps are repeated.

2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is a database that is made up of tables that hold stored information. There are other types of databases aside from relational.

Researched answer: A relational database stores data in tables that are comprised of rows and columns. Its basic functions are to read, create, update, and delete data. Other types of databases are hierarchical databases, non-relational databases, and object oriented databases.

3. Why is an ORM? 

Your answer: *did not recall discussing ORM by name, and could not think of an example*

Researched answer: ORM, or object relational mapping is the technique used to connect objects of an application to the tables of a relational database management system. It creates the connection or bridge between object-oriented programs and databases. This usually looks like using a command like 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE...' to retrieve information from another database system.

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer: JavaScript's system is based on prototypes not classes. This means that when working with class inheritance in JavaScript, the class inheritance is made on top of the prototype inheritance. This connects the child or sub class to the parent or super class. In other words, many sub-classes can be created and inherit functions from the same parent or super class. Ruby on the other hand does not support multiple class inheritance, meaning each sub class will have its own parent

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: the process of confirming that the model achieves its intended purpose.

2. Params: variables that are defined in method definition and represent the ability of a method to accept arguments.

3. API: "application program interface" - a program or interface used by developers that allows them to interact and communicate with software components or resources from other programs.
